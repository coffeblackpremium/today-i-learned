## Ok, Laravel is Web Framework, but what is MVC ?

* Model, View and Controller

* **Model**:
  >Model is where the data modeling part is usually located. Where we make our model there for the Application database that we are developing

* **View**:
   >As the name says, this is where we will display our applications to the user. Generally all Frontend parts are found here

* **Controller**:
   >Controller is responsible for controlling this user's data. The way we will treat the data in each view and how we will send or receive this data
